         <td><p>Toe was born September 23rd, 2022, in Cape Breton. His coat pattern has a heart on his back, though this does not reflect his demeanor.
            His 1st birthday party was a formal event with a bunch of women in dresses that Toe had never met before, and his owners had met only twice. Although a fan 
            of the attention recieved, Toe is not one for parties. His favorite activities include watching water drip, catching bubbles, playing games, and climbing
            the chair in the living room like a gremlin. 
            <br> Toe's favorite games include: Hide and go seek, scare the shit out of ppl from around the corner, Hunt, sit on
            Lydia's chest to wake her up at 4am, and Pounce!
