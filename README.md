Hello and welcome to the first thing I have ever tried to create! it is a blog. Does it work? not currently! Why is there a poker corner? who knows!

I'm creating this based on sheer spite. Parts of this site are created from an in-class project I did not do well on. Not only am I bitter, I am determined. I know I am a good programmer, I know what I can achieve. So here it is
My First Project. 
Hopefully it will work by the end of 2024. Thank you.
